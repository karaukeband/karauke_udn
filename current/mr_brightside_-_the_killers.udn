Mr Brightside â€“ The Killers
[intro] (C) (Cmaj7) (F) {with riff}

(C)I'm coming out of my (Cmaj7)cage,
And I've been doing just (F)fine
Gotta gotta be down, Because I want it all
(C)It started out with a (Cmaj7)kiss, How did it end up like (F)this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

(C)Now I'm falling (Cmaj7)asleep, And she's calling a (F)cab
While he's having a smoke, And she's taking a drag
(C)Now they're going to (Cmaj7)bed, And my stomach is (F)sick
And it's all in my head, But she's touching his

(Am)chest Now, he takes off her (G)dress, now
Let me (F)go
(Am)I just can't look its (G)killing me
And (F)taking control

(C)Jealousy, (F)turning saints in(Am)to the sea,
(G)Swimming through sick (C)lullabies
(F)Choking on your (Am)alibis
(G)But it's just the (C)price I pay
(F)Destiny is (Am)calling me
(G)Open up my (C)eager (F)eyes
'Cause (Am)I'm Mr (G)Brightside
