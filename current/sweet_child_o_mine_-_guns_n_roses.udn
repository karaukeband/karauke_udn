She (Bb)takes me away to that special place
And if I (F)stare too long, I'd probably break down and (C)cry

(G)Whoa, oh, oh, oh, (Bb)sweet love of (C)mine

As if (Bb)they thought of rain
I'd (F)hate to look into those eyes and (C)see an ounce of pain

Where (Bb)as a child I'd hide
(F)And pray for the thunder and the rain to (C)quietly pass me by
