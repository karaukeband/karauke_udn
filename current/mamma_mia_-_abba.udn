Mamma Mia â€“ Abba
(C) (Caug) {x2}
(C)I've been (G)cheated by (C)you since I (G)don't know (F)when
(C)So I (G)made up my (C)mind, it must (G)come to an (F)end
(C)Look at me now, (Caug)will I ever learn?
(C)I don't know how (Caug)but I suddenly (F)lose control
There's a fire with (G7)in my soul

(F)Just (C)one (G)look and I can hear a bell ring
(F)One (C)more (G)look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh

| [chorus]
| {drop out}
| (C)Mamma mia, here I go again
| (Bb)my (F)my, how can I re(C)sist you?
| (C)Mamma mia, does it show again?
| (Bb)My (F)my, just how much I've (C)missed you
| {drop in}
| Yes, I've been (G)broken hearted
| (Am)blue since the (Em)day we parted
| (Bb)Why, (F)why (Dm)did I ever (G7)let you go?
| (C)Mamma mia, (Am)now I really know,
| (Bb)My (F)my, (Dm)I could never (G7)let you go.

(C) (Caug) {x2}

(C)I've been (G)angry and (C)sad about the (G)things that you (F)do
(C)I can't (G)count all the (C)times that I've (G)told you we're (F)through
(C)And when you go, (Caug)when you slam the door
(C)I think you know (Caug)that you won't be a(F)way too long
You know that I'm (G7)not that strong.

(F)Just (C)one (G)look and I can hear a bell ring
(F)One (C)more (G)look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh

[repeat chorus]

(C)Mamma mia, (Am)even if I say
(Bb)Bye (F)bye, (Dm)leave me now or (G7)never
(C)Mamma mia, (Am)it's a game we play
(Bb)Bye (F)bye (Dm)doesn't mean for (G7)ever

[repeat chorus]
