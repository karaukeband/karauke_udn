[intro]
Now (E)I've (C#m)had the time of my (D)life

(G)I can't get enough of
(A)So I'll tell you something

So we'll (D) just let it go
don't be afraid to lose cont(E)rol
Yes I (D)know what's on your mind
when you say ‘stay with me to(E)night’
Just remember

(A)You're the one thing
(G)I can't get enough of
(A)So I'll tell you something
(Bsus4)this could be (B)love because
