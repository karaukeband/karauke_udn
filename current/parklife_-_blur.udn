[verse 1]
(E)Confidence is a preference (E7sus4)for the habitual
(E)voyeur of what is known as _(_(E7sus4)_Parklife!)_
And (E)morning soup can be avoided if (E7sus4)you take a route
(E)straight through what is known as _(_(E7sus4)_Parklife!)_
(E)John's got brewers droop, he gets in(E7sus4)timidated
by the (E)dirty pigeons, they love a bit of it _(_(E7sus4)_Parklife!)_
(E)Who's that gut lord marching? You (E7sus4)should cut down
(E)on your pork life mate, get some (E7sus4)exercise

[chorus]
(E)All (Bb)the peo(B)ple
(E)So (Bb)many peo(B)ple
And they a(G)ll (Bm)go (Em)hand in (D)hand
(C)Hand in (Em)hand through (Asus4)their (A)   (Bb)park(B7)life(D)(C)(B7)
(B7)Know what I mean?

[verse 2]
(E)I get up when I want, except on Wed(E7sus4)nesdays
when I get r(E)udely awakened by the dustmen _(_(E7sus4)_Parklife!)_
I (E)put my trousers on, have a cup of (E7sus4)tea
and I think (E)about leaving me house _(_(E7sus4)_Parklife!)_
(E)I feed the pigeons, I sometimes (E7sus4)feed the sparrows too,
it gives m(E)e a sense of enormous wellbeing _(P_(E7sus4)_arklife!)_
(E)And then I'm happy for the rest of the (E7sus4)day,
safe in the knowledge there will (E)always be a bit of my heart devo(E7sus4)ted to it
