Zombie - The Cranberries

[intro] (Em) (C) (G) (D)

(Em) Another (C)head hangs lowly
(G)Child is slowly (D)taken
(Em) And the violence (C)caused such silence
(G)Who are we mis(D)taken?

But you (Em)see, it's not me, it's not (C)my family
In your (G)head, in your head, they are (D)fighting
With their (Em)tanks, and their bombs
And their (C)bombs, and their guns
In your (G)head, in your head, they are (D)crying

In your (Em)head, in your (C)head
Zom(G)bie, zoombie, zom(D)bie hey hey
What’s in your (Em)head, in your (C)head
zom(G)bie, zombie, zom(D)bie hey hey hey
(Em)Oh (C) do-do-do
(G) Do-do-do (D) do-do-do

(Em) Another (C)mother's breakin'
(G)Heart is taking (D)over
(Em) When the violence (C)causes silence
(G)We must be mis(D)taken

It's the (Em)same old theme, since (C)1916
In your (G)head, in your head, they're still (D)fighting
With their (Em)tanks, and their bombs
And their (C)bombs, and their guns
In your (G)head, in your head, they are (D)dying

In your (Em)head, in your (C)head
zom(G)bie, zombie, zom(D)bie hey hey
What’s in your (Em)head, in your (C)head
zom(G)bie, zombie, zom(D)bie hey hey hey
(Em)Oh oh oh oh (C)oh oh oh oh
Ay (G)ohhhh ah ah (D)aaaah

(Em){single}
